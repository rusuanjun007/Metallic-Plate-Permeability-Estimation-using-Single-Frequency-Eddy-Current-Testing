The Deep Learning code for paper Metallic Plate Permeability Estimation using Single Frequency Eddy Current Testing in the Presence of Probe Lift-off

Eddy-current testing technique has been extensively explored for the electromagnetic property estimation of steel plates in various industrial applications. In this paper, a combined analytical and deep learning (DL) method has been proposed to estimate the permeability of plates in high thickness employing the single frequency inductance with probe lift-off. The simplified analytical model has been derived to supply the abundant physical information including the lift-off, initial guess of permeability, inductance spectrum, etc. The DL model based on the modified ResNet18-1D has been trained generated by the simulation samples by the analytical model. Numerical simulations and experiments have been performed to evaluate the phenomenon indicated by the proposed method and its accuracy for permeability es- timation. The method achieves the real-time accurate estimation of plate permeability with a relative error lower than 3 %.
